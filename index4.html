    <p class = "info-4"> Toby Maguire's spiderman is ofton seen as The "strongest spiderman" who also not only starts the 
        franchise with his triligy but his own depth and perception on the character starting off the 
        multiple variants of the character and story. he is often viewed as the more self-observant and 
        he tries to keep his respinibilities in order. He presented peter as this awkward, lonely guy who was 
        strugling with social isolation. He is more of a quiet speaker unlike mr. holland and mr. garfeld's versons
        of the character. he is seen as someone who would usually sacrifice his own happiness for others. with 
        mr. maguires verson of peter parker he took a diffrent approch with instead of seeing his powers as a 
        oppertunity he sees it as more of an obligation or someting he has to do rather than something he would
        want to do instead. his verson of spiderman shows how peter parker has an emotinal burden of being a hero
        as well as includes moments of self doubt and his desire to give up being spiderman.
