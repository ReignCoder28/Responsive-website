    <p class="Info"> There are multiple versions of Spiderman depicted by Different actors. 
        All are different from each other. For example from various youtube channels 
        and peoples personal opinions through the commets as well as the videos themselves 
        I have noticed all three versions are seen differently. tobey maguires is seen as more 
        sincere or serious. However on the other side of things Andrew Garfield is seen as the more 
        emotionally complex and rebellious spiderman. and Tom Holland is seen as the smartest spiderman
        who has the humor and awkwardness of a dorky teenager. Each one has their own 
        strengths and weaknesses. They also have their similarities they keep up with mainly
         because it is what they do to show itâ€™s spiderman.

    <p class="Info">
        All actors do take a good amount of things into consideration and they give their 
        versons of how they belive the character would react in that senario. However they All
        keep parts that make the character uniqe and actually feel like the character at the same 
        time. they keep the vulnarabilities, morals, and the thoughts of what 
        actual teenagers would do in the senario within the actual character they were acting out so 
        it would still have the same feel to it but in the way they want people to see it.

        With Each persons verson of spiderman being played in such a captivating light and lense that is so 
        vastly similr yet diffrent how do they each bring their own various fiters to the same charicter?
        as mentioned before people have their own views on how each actor plays spiderman but lets look in 
        depth at all of the versons of spiderman and how exactly each actor develops the charicter 
        in their own way. (click on a picture to hear more about my opinons! :))))
