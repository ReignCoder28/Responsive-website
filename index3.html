<body> Andrew garfeld's has this version spiderman who tends to be viewed through a edgier lense. his 
        spiderman has various complex emotions that are put into perspective 
        that is easy yet hard to comprehend at the same time. His version of spiderman
        is actually physically bullied and seen more as this type of "loser"
        rather than a "nobody" or actually liked by someone. aside from
        gwen stacey that is. people tend to say he is the more attractive spiderman mainly because
         he can relate to people who are rebellious or people feel he is relatible in that scense
        of the rebellious teenager who could be awkward at times. he has more of a angsty and 
        a bit of an confident modern take on the charicter. He has more confidence while dealing with bullies
        rather than just ignoring them like mr. holland and mr. magurire do in their versions. mr. garfeld's
        spiderman is depicted as a teenager who is a loner by choice and someone who often broots. Both inside
        and out of the suit his personality usually shines through. he is usually sarcastic and often taunts his 
        enemies. although even though he could be humorous he can be serious.
