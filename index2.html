    Tom holland has currated this Spiderman who likes things that 
    some real people like but it may make them feel
    like they are seen as "nerds" or not as popular and because of
    his depiction of it and the type of light he brings to not only the actual 
    subjects themselves but also the respinibilities peter parker would
    have to handle as not only spiderman but also as a "striving to be accademicly on top"
    kind of teenager. His verson is seen as peter being more 
    reckless but having a lot of potentel to grow and mature at the same time
    into this amazing hero and person who can in fact handle everything as a mature adult
    and in a less reckless way. seen in spiderman homecoming Mr. holland show how Peter learns 
    that there is a lot more to being a hero than just having a flashy suit.
    Him saying "I'm nothing without the suit" and tony taking it away shows how 
    the character development Mr. holland brought with it is something even a teenager today can learn and grow
    from. His emotions show more depth in the character 
    as well because when seen in spiderman far from home he relized from beck
    that at that point forward he would be possablly 
    dealing with villans who would be willing to kill him with no hesitation as well as manipulate Him
    or people around Him. even through the verson mr. holland
    showed he was very compationate and caring he had to learn how to set boundries
    and learn to navigate negative emotions this is seen as 
    relatible to normal teenagers as well. 
    More of this is shown in spiderman no way home Because the anger Mr. holland acted out
    at the end of the movie painted a picture of this teenager who had 
    very rapid emotions and how the charicter would have felt
    fighting someone who just killed his aunt. As if quite litteraly 
    anger was spewing from his guts and all he had on his mind was 
    revenge because he seen what the green goblin did was injust.
    the feelings bubbling over his extremely high limit and tolerance as well as the reckless due to 
    the swarming emotions a teenager would possablly feel and actions they would take 
    was taken into consideration and distributed though a very powerfull filter not all 
    actors can make happen. It felt as if he were actually there feeling the very emotions
    peter parker in that senario was feeling. it gave a lot of character development and overall 
    a type of feeling that could be seen in the other actors who played spiderman 
    but diffrent in his own showcase of the character at the same time.
